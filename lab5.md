_The java files and bash script are from the week 6 lab._

Student's problem:
Hi, I am working on the bash script from the week 6 lab. I wrote two tests, one for the merge functino and the other one is for the filter functino. I was able to detect compile error and return a zero score for the repository with syntax error https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-f22/list-methods-compile-error. However, I wasn't able to return a perfect score for the correct repository https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-f22/list-methods-corrected. I checked the return status of ```javac -cp $CPATH *.java``` with the command ```echo "$?"```, and the return status is 0 which means the corrected file compile perfectly.
