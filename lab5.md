## Part 1

_The java files and bash script are from the week 6 lab._

Student's problem:
Hi, I am working on the bash script from the week 6 lab. All the given github respitoray behaved as expected and my bash script was able to return a score respectively, except for the one with argument types in the wrong order. Somehow the score returned for this test was is 1/1, indicating it's correct which wasn't. I was expecting the return value to be 0/1 since there should be an invalid argument error.
