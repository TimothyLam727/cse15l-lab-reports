  * There was no output after the command was run
  * The working directory was **/home** before the command was run, and remained the same when the command was run
  * It is reasonable to not receive an output after running the command since there was no argument in the command line. There wasn't a 
    targeted directory that the command asked the terminal to change to, thus the terminal wouldn't change the directory

2. With a path to a directory as an argument
