   * There was no output after the command was run
   * It is reasonable to not receive an output after running the command since the command **cd** is only used to change the directory and 
     wouldn't return or produce any output
   * The working directory was **/home** before the command was run, and remained the same when the command was run
   * There was no argument in the command line. There wasn't an argument (targeted directory) in the command line that the command asked 
     the terminal to change to, therefore, the terminal wouldn't change the directory and nothing changed


2. With a path to a directory as an argument

   * There was also no output after the command was run
   * Same reason that there was no output since **cd** wouldn't return or produce anything but change the directory
   * However, the prompt changed. It changed from **[user@sahara ~]$** to **[user@sahara ~/lecture1]$**
   * The working directory was changed from **/home** to **/home/lecture1**
   * Since the argument **lecture1** was included in the command line, the terminal was told to change the directory to **lecture1**. Thus, 
     the final working directory was **home/lecture1**



3. With a path to a file as an argument
